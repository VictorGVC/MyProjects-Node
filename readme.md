As a differential, it will be possible for the frontend to choose in which language the backend should run.

## Features üåü

## Long Description üßæ

This NodeJS repository is a part of the multilanguage project, whose main objective is to manage data, performing basic CRUP operations. In this project I decided to control ``users`` and ``projects`` to store my projects with my personal data like a portfolio.

To achieve the objective I used:
- ``Node.JS`` as runtime to ``Javascript``;
- ``Express.JS`` to help create the api;
- ``Consign`` to autoload scripfiles, simplifying the process of exporting and importing modules;
- ``Bcrypt`` to encrypt passwords at signin and signup;
- ``JWT`` for secure session control;
- ``Passport`` to encrypt and decrypt the JWT token;
- ``PostgreSQL`` as relational database system;
- ``Knex`` as SQL query builder and migrations manager;
- ``Cors`` to make secure cross-origin requests and responses.
- ``Postman`` as API client to make tests
- ``Heroku`` as cloud CI/CD

## How to use üë®‚Äçüíª

This Node.JS backend was made to work with <a href="https://github.com/VictorGVC/ProjectMultilanguage-React">Frontend React</a>, but if you want to use it by yourself you can use an API client using the routes below and following the instructions for each one.

### Routes

In this session will be discribed all routes to access the software functions with the corresponding instructions.

#### Signup
``multilanguage-node.herokuapp.com/signup``

First of all you need to register, because This project have a session control, if you don't you won't be able to access any other system function. To do this it's necessary to send via post a body with the username, password and confirmPassword fields to the Route above, the password and confirmPassword fields must be identical or it will return an error.

Example:
```json
{
    "username": "VictorGVC",
    "password": "123456",
    "confirmPassword": "123456"
}
```

In case of success, the API will return status 201 with the message:
```User saved```
