## About üéØ

This is the Node.js backend of the multilanguage project, whose main objective is to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of ``users``, ``projects`` and ``technologies``. As a differential, it will be possible for the frontend to choose in which language the backend should run.

## Features üåü

- [x] `` Users``
- [x] ``Technologies``
- [x] ``Projects``

## Long Description üßæ

This NodeJS repository is a part of the multilanguage project, whose main objective is to manage data, performing basic CRUP operations. In this project I decided to control ``users`` and ``projects`` to store my projects with my personal data like a portfolio.

To achieve the objective I used:
- ``Node.JS`` as runtime to ``Javascript``;
- ``Express.JS`` to help create the api;
- ``Consign`` to autoload scripfiles, simplifying the process of exporting and importing modules;
- ``Bcrypt`` to encrypt passwords at signin and signup;
- ``JWT`` for secure session control;
- ``Passport`` to encrypt and decrypt the JWT token;
- ``PostgreSQL`` as relational database system;
- ``Knex`` as SQL query builder and migrations manager;
- ``Cors`` to make secure cross-origin requests and responses.
- ``Postman`` as API client to make tests
- ``Heroku`` as cloud CI/CD

## How to use üë®‚Äçüíª

This Node.JS backend was made to work with <a href="https://github.com/VictorGVC/ProjectMultilanguage-React">Frontend React</a>, but if you want to use it by yourself you can use an API client using the routes below and following the instructions for each one.

### Routes

In this session will be discribed all routes to access the software functions with the corresponding instructions.

#### Signup
``multilanguage-node.herokuapp.com/signup``

First of all you need to register, because This project have a session control, if you don't you won't be able to access any other API function. To do this it's necessary to send via post a body with the username, password and confirmPassword fields to the Route above, the password and confirmPassword fields must be identical or it will return an error.

Example:
```json
{
    "username": "victor",
    "password": "123456",
    "confirmPassword": "123456"
}
```

In case of success, the API will return status 201 with the message:
```User saved```

#### Signin

``multilanguage-node.herokuapp.com/signin``

After the signup you need to signin to get the JWT token, without the JWT token you won't be able to access any other API function. To do this it's necessary to send via post a body with the username, password of your user.

Example:
```json
{
    "username": "victor",
    "password": "123456"
}
```

In case of success, the API will return status 200 with a json like:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "username": "victor",
    "admin": false,
    "iat": 1647880960,
    "exp": 1647888160,
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJ2aWN0b3IiLCJhZG1pbiI6ZmFsc2UsImlhdCI6MTY0Nzg4MDk2MCwiZXhwIjoxNjQ3ODg4MTYwfQ.CJeTRyMBxwhz3TxJU8o3UU50QJFJVmHo44MHc2UqGoY"
}
```

Now you will need to save the token that you received to access another default function for three hours.
To actually have access to the functions it is necessary to add two fields to the request header, as shown below:

OBS: some functions is only for admins, if you want to be an admin ask to request access to the repository owner.

```json
{
    "Authorization": "bearer {yourToken}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```
